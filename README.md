# Election_2021_Gtrends

using Google trends to analyze election of Naftali Bennett

This is an R project created in July 2021 in order to understand how the world became familiar with Naftali Bennett, 1st prime minister in Israel since Benjamin Netanyahu was elected in 2009.

I wanted to save and evolve this little visualization into a small project of presenting Google trends importing data project.
