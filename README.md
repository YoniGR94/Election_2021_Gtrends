### Using Google trends to analyze election of Naftali Bennett

This is an R project created in July 2021 in order to understand how the world became familiar with Naftali Bennett, 1st prime minister in Israel since Benjamin Netanyahu was elected in 2009.

I wanted to save and evolve this little visualization into a small project of presenting Google trends importing data project.

In this graph we can see how popular was Bennett at firs, when no one know him before. Indeed, the parts of world where Israel is considered interesting had to seach about himonce he became a new prime minister, unlike the already known candidate Netanyahu.
